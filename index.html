						<h1>Hello there!	</h1>
						<p>Hi, my name's Rhydian. Welcome to my personal site! I'm a final year physics Master's<br />undergraduate at the University of Manchester. Academically, I'm interested in <br>machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence. Otherwise, I enjoy sports (especially <br>climbing and  rugby), baking and good films. Come and have a look at the stuff I get upto.</p>

										<h3>A short bio</h3>
										<p>	</p>
										<p>That's me on the left. I was born in 1996 in Atlanta, USA but my parents moved back to the UK and so I grew up in the town of Shrewsbury. At secondary school I was given a scholarship to Wrekin College, where I developed my love of sport, in particular rugby and running. I was also elected Head Boy during my final year. Due to some fantastic teaching, I decided I wanted to study physics at university and was offered a scholarship at the University of Manchester for my A level results. </p>
										<p>Over the course of my degree, I have developed an interest in machine learning, aritificial intelligence and statistical science, which was cemented by my summer internship (see selected projects). I am hoping to pursue further study applying machine learning in real-world systems to generate insights and develop intelligent software and machinery.</p>

									<h3>Outside of Work/Contact Information</h3>
									<p> When I'm not hacking away at a computer machine, you'll often find me at the climbing wall, out on a run or baking (I've only got into this recently so I'm not very good!). The picture on the right is of Manchester Physics Rugby team, who I've played for since beginning university. </p>

									<h3>Lung Cancer Shrinkage</h3>
									<p>My MPhys project performed in collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-needham-69049b12b/"> George Needham </a> , we are working at the Christie Cancer Research centre in Manchester, exploring the link between lung cancer tissue density during radiotherapy and the likelihood of relapse.</p>

									<h3>SecCam footfall mapping</h3>
									<p>My summer research internship, performed for the Victoria and Albert Waterfront in Cape Town, South Africa. I used computer vision techniques on security camera footage from the Waterfront to create a system to count the number of pedestrians passing through the area. This project was my first real experience of applying machine learning to a real-world problem. </p>
